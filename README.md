# Philosophy

This is where I have a lot of my writings available online, either for class or for fun. Please cite anything used from here!
I'm also putting them here so I can cite myself when I re-use ideas from earlier works of mine.

## Conventions for using this Wring

Please feel free to use my philosophy, just be sure to cite it properly or whatever.

Some of the work here is under the pseuodonym "Lee" (as to not give away directly that I wrote it in the middle of my debate round).

Just as the adjective for morality under Kant's ideas are "Kantian", let my system of philosophy be known as "Leesian".

### What it is to be

This was a book written for my debate club.

First release of this book is [here](https://github.com/SylvanM/Philosophy/releases/tag/1.0.0 "First Release")

I do Lincoln Douglas (LD) high school debate. In LD, cases are written around a central framework, which is often some
sort of philosophical framework dictating how we decide what actions are "moral" or "desirable" or whatever.

Lots of people may have their central framework something like "Locke's Social Contract Theory," and they will then say that
it is the duty of the government to blah blah blah and people owe the government blah blah blah. Then they will write their
case around this central idea.

When I heard this, I thought, "wait a second, all these philosophies people are using were made up by other people. Who's to 
say these 'philosophers' are so enlightened? Why can't I write my own philosophy?"

When I raised this issue with those on my debate team, they told me that we had to use a philosophy that was a published,
written work in the public domain.

So here it is. I am writing this in spite of those who told me I couldn't write my own.

### Finding Friendship in the Absence of Universal Values

This was a paper I wrote for a writing seminar in college, about friendship in a liberal society.
